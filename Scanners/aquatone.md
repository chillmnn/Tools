# Aquatone

Is a nice tool to perform drive-by screenshots on websites.
I find it easier to install and more reliable than Eyewitness and Gowitness as I always run into errors with these to tools.

Download the version of Aquatone base on OS and extract to directory of choice. `https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone/releases/tag/v1.7.0`

Download Chrome on Kali `google.com/chrome`

Install Chrome `apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb`

Can also install Chromium for better results. `sudo apt install chromium`

Usage: `cat alivedomains.txt | ./aquatone`
